# Vision
SnesXM is intended to be a Super NES emulator written in C#.

## Philosphy
Overall, I would to create some editor tools that would be helpful to [MushROMs](https://github.com/bonimy/MushROMs). This is an insane undertaking and likely won't go anywhere, but I would at least like to try.

## Open Source
Like [MushROMs](https://github.com/bonimy/MushROMs), I fully intend on keeping this project public and open source.

For more information on the value of open source, read the [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/).

## Cross platform
In conjunction with open source, cross platform is an essential component of SnesXM; it should be accessible to anyone on any OS. Making cross-platform projects also becomes easier for open source projects where users with different setups can contribute.

## Full documentation
Sometimes, the biggest challenge of contributing to a new project is understanding what all of the code does. For this reason, it is our philosophy that every function, module, and component be documented and outlined, and have relevant example code to show users how its used and why. SnesXM utilizes [Sandcastle Help File Builder (SHFB)](https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB/releases) to build the documentation. SHFB uses formatted comments in source code files to build documentation pages in many formats, including HTML, Markdown, and Windows Help File.

## Community driven environment
Ultimately, I want this to be a project that a lot of people could be passionate about. I want a lot of resources and a lot of information present so people can pick up the information easily and be ready to use SnesXM however they can, or contribute to it in any way they like. Please follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for a more detailed explanation of working in a community project.
